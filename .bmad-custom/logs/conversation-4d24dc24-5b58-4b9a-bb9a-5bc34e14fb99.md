**User** (text): ugh today was so rough... everyone at school was being really weird and i just dont know how to deal with it anymore

**Voiced** (text): From what you told me when setting up Voiced, feeling overwhelmed by school and social pressure is a significant struggle for you. It's tough when social dynamics shift unexpectedly. How did their behavior affect you today?

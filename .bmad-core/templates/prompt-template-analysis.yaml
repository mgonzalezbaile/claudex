      "Focus analysis on {{SPECIFIC_ASPECT}}. Ignore {{WHAT_TO_EXCLUDE}}."
    elicit: true
    type: code-block
    examples:
      - |
        ```txt

        Focus analysis on actionable insights. Ignore historical context unless directly relevant.

  - id: output-format
    title: "OUTPUT FORMAT"
    instruction: |
      Define analysis brief structure. Use consistent format optimized for scanning.

      Recommended structure:

      **[Concise Heading (≤10 words)]**

      **Key Findings:**
      - **Finding 1**: [One sentence]
        - Evidence: [Cite data]
        - Implication: [So what?]
        - Action: [What to do]

      - **Finding 2**: [One sentence]
        - Evidence: [Cite data]
        - Implication: [So what?]
        - Action: [What to do]

      [Repeat for 3-5 findings max]

      Alternatives:
      - Bullet format (finding → implication → action)
      - Table format (Finding | Evidence | Action)
      - Executive summary + details

      Choose format based on audience and complexity.
    elicit: true
    type: code-block
    examples:
      - |
        Format your analysis as:

        **[Brief Heading]**

        **Key Findings** (3-5 bullets):
        - **Finding**: [One sentence observation]
          - **Evidence**: [Specific data point]
          - **Implication**: [Why this matters]
          - **Action**: [Recommended next step]

        Maximum 150 words total.

  - id: constraints
    title: "ANALYSIS CONSTRAINTS"
    instruction: |
      Add specific constraints for this analysis type.

      Common constraints:
      - Top N items only (top 3 findings, top 5 risks)
      - Prioritization criteria (by impact, urgency, feasibility)
      - Evidence requirements (must cite data, no opinions)
      - Confidence levels (if uncertainty exists)
      - Time horizon (short-term vs long-term implications)

      Keep to 3-5 specific constraints.
    elicit: true
    type: bullet-list
    examples:
      - "- Maximum 3 findings, prioritized by business impact"
      - "- Each finding must cite specific data from INPUT"
      - "- Each action must be achievable within 30 days"
      - "- Include confidence level (high/medium/low) for each finding"

  - id: remember
    title: "REMEMBER"
    instruction: |
      Restate 1-2 critical analysis principles.

      Typically:
      - Answer-first structure
      - Word/finding limit
      - Actionability requirement
      - Evidence citation

      Keep to 2-3 bullets max.
    elicit: true
    type: bullet-list
    examples:
      - "- Answer-first, maximum 120 words"
      - "- 3 findings maximum, each with specific action"
      - "- Cite evidence from INPUT for every claim"

  usage_notes: |
    This template is optimized for analysis tasks where:
    - Output drives decisions (not just information)
    - Brevity is critical (exec summaries, quick briefs)
    - Actionability matters more than completeness
    - Reader needs to scan and act quickly
    - Data/evidence must support claims

    Key differences from general template:
    - Emphasizes answer-first structure
    - Strict brevity constraints
    - Focus on finding → implication → action pattern
    - Prioritization built in (top N)
    - Evidence citation required

    Common use cases:
    - Executive summaries
    - Competitive intelligence briefs
    - Technical feasibility assessments
    - User research synthesis
    - Risk analysis reports
    - Market opportunity briefs

  customization_tips: |
    Customize by:
    1. Set word/sentence limit appropriate for audience
    2. Define prioritization criteria (impact, urgency, etc.)
    3. Choose output structure (bullets, table, heading+body)
    4. Specify number of findings (3-5 typical)
    5. Add domain-specific constraints
    6. Define confidence/uncertainty handling
